[David Foster Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace) is one of my favorite modern writers. 

Some authors create extrodinary scenes and elaborate on some great fantasy. DFW, on the other hand, has a way of describing perfectly ordinary situations while allowing them to retain their banality. To him, [state fairs are still filled with herds of people fighting for their place in line at the food booth](http://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/HarpersMagazine-1994-07-0001729.pdf), and [lobster festivals are still hot, loud, and sickening](http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2004/08/consider_the_lobster).

I've gotten fed up with the culture of irony that seems so pervasive in America today, especially for those in their 20s. Jokes are made sarcastically, media is pre-emptively mocking, and opinions are expressed disingenuously. Cultural ideas seem to spin around and become digested once, twice, and over again. These ideas are referential, often turning in and becoming *self*-referential. 

DFW wrote a great piece on fiction writing that encompassed the topic of irony and self-reference within media. [E Unibus Pluram](http://jsomers.net/DFW_TV.pdf) is a work that helped me organize my feelings about the current state of American youth culture. It contains some great insights into TV advertising and media consumption, both of which play a big role in my day-to-day.
